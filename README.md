# Connecting
Web Storytelling Project developed with React.js, Context API, React Router and Create-React-App

**[TL;DR]**
I am a university student and this project is meant to allow us to put our storytelling skills into practice through the creation of a website. **Connecting**, even though it sounds like a state, is actually the title of the website. This project, indeed, aims to raise some reflections on how we think - or don't think - about others and the scope of our actions. The website is developed using React.js, Context API, and React Router, leveraging on the Create-React-App toolkit.

**However**, be aware that knowing the "behind the scenes" of the project and the messages I would like it to convey is likely to _change the way you experience it_.

Now, let's get to the long answer...

# The Project
This project is an opportunity to learn and put into practice new skills. I am a beginner, however, I'm very excited and positive.
In the wiki, I will explain the meaning of the project and keep track of the process as I develop the website and work on the story.
