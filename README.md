# Connecting
Web Storytelling Project developed with React.js, Context API, React Router and Create-React-App

---

**[TL;DR]** I am a university student and this project aims to put into practice our storytelling skills through the creation of a website.

## The Project

This project is an opportunity to learn and put into practice new skills. I am definitely a beginner, however, I'm very excited and positive. In the wiki, I will explain the meaning of the project and the process as I develop the website and work on the story.

The website is developed using React.js, Context API, and React Router, levering on the Create-React-App toolkit.
